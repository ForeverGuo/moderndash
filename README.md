## ðŸ”– Introduction
I developed ModernDash as an modern lightweight alternative to Lodash and other utility libraries.  
ModernDash provides powerful functions while encouraging you to use native JS where its appropriate.

Why would i need:
- `ModernDash.isArray()` when there is `Array.isArray()`
- `Lodash.compact(array)` when i could write `array.filter(Boolean)`

It ignores trivial functions and focuses of the functions you actually need.
## ðŸ’¾ Installation

```bash
npm install moderndash
```

## Why is X lodash function not included?
Please check [You-Dont-Need-Lodash](https://github.com/you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need-Lodash-Underscore) for native replacements.  
If you still think a function is missing open an issue.
